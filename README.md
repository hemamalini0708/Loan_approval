The Loan Prediction System helps in evaluating loan eligibility based on key financial and personal details. By analyzing factors such as income, credit history, employment status, and property location, the system provides an accurate assessment of whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

How It Works:

**User Input**: The applicant provides details like income, credit history, education level, and property area.

**Analysis**: The system processes this data using predefined criteria to determine loan eligibility.

**Prediction**: Based on the analysis, the system predicts if the loan will be approved or not approved.
